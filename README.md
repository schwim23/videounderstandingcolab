# videounderstandingcolab
This is a Colab notebook I created to demonstrated some of the video understanding capabilities of Gemini (using Gemini 2.0 Flash.) The prompt includes the link to a video and asks Gemini to summarize the content and analzye the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of any commercial product it recognizes in the video and also to select the one item with the best overall sentiment that is mentioned in the video. 

The Colab uses the Google Python GenAI SDK (https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/)
